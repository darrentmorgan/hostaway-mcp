**Remote API**: http://72.60.233.157:8080
**API Key**: `mcp_x64EA0rh4EPmDsi8tVy-xzomCFTV1rApJmQdXGE-j00`

## Available MCP Tools

Once you restart Claude Desktop, these tools will be available:

1. **list_properties** - List all Hostaway properties with pagination
2. **get_property_details** - Get detailed information about a specific property
3. **check_availability** - Check property availability for a date range
4. **search_bookings** - Search bookings with filters (status, dates, etc.)
5. **get_booking_details** - Get detailed booking information
6. **get_guest_info** - Get guest information for a booking
7. **get_financial_reports** - Get financial reports with revenue/expense breakdown

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Restart Claude Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must completely quit and restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.

**macOS**:
```bash
# Quit Claude Desktop (Cmd+Q)
# Or force quit from terminal:
pkill -9 "Claude"

# Then reopen Claude Desktop from Applications
```

### 2. Verify MCP Connection

Start a new conversation in Claude Desktop and ask:

```
What Hostaway MCP tools are available?
```

You should see a list of 7 tools.

### 3. Test with Real Data

Try asking Claude to:

```
Can you list my Hostaway properties?
```

or

```
Show me recent bookings from the last 30 days
```

or

```
What's my financial performance this month?
```

Claude should now be able to retrieve and analyze your real Hostaway data!

---

## Troubleshooting

### If MCP tools don't appear:

1. **Check Claude Desktop logs**:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
   ```

2. **Verify configuration file syntax**:
   ```bash
   cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json | jq
   ```

   Should parse without errors.

3. **Test MCP server manually**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/darrenmorgan/AI_Projects/hostaway-mcp
   REMOTE_MCP_URL="http://72.60.233.157:8080" \
   REMOTE_MCP_API_KEY="mcp_x64EA0rh4EPmDsi8tVy-xzomCFTV1rApJmQdXGE-j00" \
   uv run python mcp_stdio_server.py
   ```

   Type: `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "initialize", "params": {"protocolVersion": "2024-11-05", "capabilities": {}, "clientInfo": {"name": "test", "version": "1.0"}}}`

   Should respond with initialization response.

4. **Verify remote server is accessible**:
   ```bash
   curl http://72.60.233.157:8080/health
   ```

   Should return healthy status.

### If you get authentication errors:

The API key should be working, but if you see 401 errors:

```bash
# Test API key directly
curl -H "X-API-Key: mcp_x64EA0rh4EPmDsi8tVy-xzomCFTV1rApJmQdXGE-j00" \
  http://72.60.233.157:8080/api/listings?limit=3
```

Should return property listings.

## What This Enables

With this MCP integration, you can now ask Claude to:

- **Property Management**:
  - "Show me all available properties"
  - "What properties do I have in Bali?"
  - "Check availability for Villa Roma next week"

- **Booking Management**:
  - "List all upcoming bookings"
  - "Show me guest details for booking #12345"
  - "What bookings do I have this month?"

- **Financial Reporting**:
  - "Generate a financial report for Q1 2025"
  - "What's my revenue breakdown by property?"
  - "Show me expense analysis for last month"

- **Analysis & Insights**:
  - "Which property has the highest occupancy rate?"
  - "What's my average booking value?"
  - "Compare revenue year-over-year"

Claude will automatically call the appropriate MCP tools to fetch real-time data from your Hostaway account!
