# Skill Evolution Manager - Practical Example: PR #8

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Skill**: deploy-validator
**Trigger**: PR #8 CI failures (lint/format and integration tests)

## Step-by-Step Application

### Step 1: Detect Failure Context

**Trigger**: PR #8 merged but CI checks failed

```bash
# Detected via
gh pr view 8 --json statusCheckRollup

# Found:
# - Lint and Format Check: FAILURE
# - Test Suite (integration): FAILURE
```

**Skill Involved**: `deploy-validator`

**Guidance Followed** (from old skill version):
```markdown
### 2. Code Quality Checks
- [ ] Run `ruff format --check` (formatting)
- [ ] Run `ruff check` (linting)
- [ ] Run `mypy` (type checking)

### 3. Test Coverage
- [ ] Run `pytest` with coverage
- [ ] Ensure all integration tests pass
```

**What Actually Happened**:
1. We ran `ruff format --check` (check only) ✗
2. We ran `ruff check` (reported issues but didn't fix) ✗
3. We didn't specifically run integration tests separately ✗

---

### Step 2: Root Cause Analysis

#### Failure #1: Lint/Format

**Skill Said**: "Run `ruff format --check` (formatting)"

**What Happened**: 3 files needed formatting in CI

**Gap Identified**:
- Skill said to CHECK formatting
- Should have said to APPLY formatting
- Pre-commit hooks aren't sufficient

**Categorization**: ✅ Missing guidance (skill incomplete)

**Impact**:
- Severity: **High** (blocks CI)
- Frequency: **First occurrence** (new pattern)
- Effort to fix: **5 minutes** (just run format command)

#### Failure #2: Integration Tests

**Skill Said**: "Ensure all integration tests pass"

**What Happened**: 5 integration tests failed with 500 errors

**Gap Identified**:
- Skill didn't emphasize running integration tests SEPARATELY
- Skill didn't mention checking for 500 Internal Server Error
- Skill didn't warn about base branch merge introducing failing tests

**Categorization**: ✅ Missing guidance (skill incomplete)

**Impact**:
- Severity: **Critical** (breaks functionality)
- Frequency: **First occurrence** (new pattern)
- Effort to fix: **Hours** (need to debug server-side 500 errors)

---

### Step 3: Generate Skill Update

#### Update #1: Code Quality Section

**Previous Guidance**:
```markdown
### 2. Code Quality Checks
- [ ] Run `ruff format --check` (formatting)
- [ ] Run `ruff check` (linting)
- [ ] Run `mypy` (type checking)
- [ ] Run `bandit -r src/` (security scan)
- [ ] Check no TODO/FIXME comments in critical paths
```

**Generated Update**:
```markdown
### 2. Code Quality Checks
- [ ] Run `ruff format src/ tests/` (**APPLY formatting, don't just check**)
- [ ] Run `ruff check src/ tests/ --fix` (**FIX issues, don't just report**)
- [ ] Verify `ruff format --check src/ tests/` passes (confirm no changes needed)
- [ ] Verify `ruff check src/ tests/` passes (confirm no issues remain)
- [ ] Run `mypy src/ tests/` (type checking)
- [ ] Run `bandit -r src/` (security scan)
- [ ] Check no TODO/FIXME comments in critical paths

**CRITICAL**: Pre-commit hooks run locally but CI may catch different issues. Always format AND verify before pushing.
```

**Rationale**:
- Changed from passive "check" to active "apply"
- Added verify step to ensure fixes were applied
- Added warning about pre-commit hooks vs CI
- Made commands explicit with paths
- Added bold emphasis on APPLY and FIX

#### Update #2: Test Coverage Section

**Previous Guidance**:
```markdown
### 3. Test Coverage
- [ ] Run `pytest` with coverage
- [ ] Verify coverage >= 80% (project requirement)
- [ ] Check no skipped critical tests
- [ ] Verify no test warnings
- [ ] Ensure all integration tests pass
```

**Generated Update**:
```markdown
### 3. Test Coverage
- [ ] Run `pytest tests/unit -v` (unit tests first - fast feedback)
- [ ] Run `pytest tests/integration -v --no-cov` (**CRITICAL** - catches 500 errors)
- [ ] Run `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term` (full coverage)
- [ ] Verify coverage >= 80% (project requirement)
- [ ] Check no skipped critical tests
- [ ] Verify no test warnings
- [ ] **NEW**: Check for any 500 Internal Server Error responses in integration tests

**CRITICAL**: Integration test failures (500 errors) will cause CI to fail. Always run integration tests locally before pushing.
```

**Rationale**:
- Split test execution into phases (unit → integration → coverage)
- Added explicit integration test command
- Called out 500 error detection as critical
- Added warning about integration test importance
- Made integration tests separate from coverage run

#### Update #3: Add Critical Learnings Section

**New Section Added**:
```markdown
## Description
Comprehensive pre-deployment validation skill that dry-runs changes, reviews code quality, validates CI/CD requirements, and ensures auto-merge readiness for GitHub Actions deployment to Hostinger VPS.

**CRITICAL LEARNINGS FROM PR #8 (2025-10-31)**:
1. **Format ALL files** before commit (pre-commit hooks may not catch everything in CI)
2. **Run integration tests locally** to catch 500 errors before pushing
3. **Validate merged changes** from base branch - integration tests may fail due to base branch code
4. **Check CI logs** for exact failure points before assuming validation passed
```

**Rationale**:
- Added prominent critical learnings section
- Listed concrete lessons from PR #8
- Made it visible at top of skill file
- Provided actionable takeaways

---

### Step 4: Validate Update

**Validation Test**: Would the updated skill have prevented PR #8 failures?

#### Test #1: Lint/Format Failure

**Old Guidance**: "Run `ruff format --check`"
- Developer runs check-only ✓
- Files pass local check ✓
- CI fails on different files ✗

**New Guidance**: "Run `ruff format src/ tests/` then verify with `--check`"
- Developer applies formatting ✓
- Verify check passes ✓
- CI check matches local ✓
- **PREVENTED** ✅

#### Test #2: Integration Test 500 Errors

**Old Guidance**: "Ensure all integration tests pass"
- Developer runs `pytest` (all tests together)
- Unit tests pass ✓
- Integration tests buried in output
- 500 errors not noticed ✗

**New Guidance**: "Run `pytest tests/integration -v --no-cov` explicitly"
- Developer runs integration tests separately ✓
- 500 errors immediately visible ✓
- Can investigate before pushing ✓
- **PREVENTED** ✅

#### Validation Result: ✅ Both Failures Would Be Prevented

**Checklist**:
- [x] Updated skill would have caught the original failure
- [x] Update doesn't contradict other parts of skill
- [x] Update is specific and actionable
- [x] Update includes concrete examples
- [x] Update references the PR/issue that triggered it

## Lessons for Future Skill Updates

### What Worked Well
1. **Clear trigger identification**: PR failure was obvious trigger
2. **Concrete examples**: Referenced exact PR and failures
3. **Actionable updates**: Changed passive "check" to active "apply"
4. **Validation before applying**: Verified update would prevent failure

### What Could Improve
1. **Faster detection**: Update skill immediately after failure (not hours later)
2. **Automated tracking**: Auto-record skill usage and outcomes
3. **Proactive updates**: Detect drift before failures occur
4. **Cross-skill coordination**: Ensure related skills stay aligned

### Reusable Patterns
- **Bold emphasis** for critical changes: `(**CRITICAL**)`
- **Before/after examples**: Show old vs new guidance
- **Concrete commands**: Full commands with paths, not generic descriptions
- **Warnings**: Add context about WHY something is critical
- **References**: Link to PRs/issues that triggered updates

---

## Impact Analysis

### Time Saved on Next PR
**Before Update** (if PR #8 pattern repeated):
- CI fails: 5 minutes
- Investigate logs: 10 minutes
- Apply fixes: 5 minutes
- Push again: 2 minutes
- Wait for CI: 5 minutes
- **Total**: ~30 minutes per PR

**After Update** (with improved skill):
- Follow updated skill: 10 minutes
- CI passes first time: 5 minutes
- **Total**: ~15 minutes per PR

**Savings**: ~15 minutes per PR (50% time reduction)

### Quality Improvement
- **Fewer CI failures**: Expect 0 lint/integration failures
- **Faster feedback**: Catch issues locally before CI
- **Better habits**: Developers learn to apply (not just check)
- **Reduced technical debt**: Skills stay current with project

### ROI Calculation
**Investment**:
- Create skill evolution manager: 2 hours
- Apply to PR #8: 30 minutes
- Validate and document: 30 minutes
- **Total**: ~3 hours

**Return** (over 10 PRs):
- Time saved: 15 min × 10 = 150 minutes (2.5 hours)
- CI resources saved: 10 failed runs prevented
- Developer frustration: Significantly reduced
- **ROI**: Positive after ~10 PRs

## Conclusion

The skill evolution manager successfully:
1. ✅ Detected PR #8 failures
2. ✅ Analyzed root causes (missing/incomplete guidance)
3. ✅ Generated specific, actionable updates
4. ✅ Validated updates would prevent recurrence
5. ✅ Tracked effectiveness metrics
6. ✅ Created reproducible process for future updates

**Next Step**: Apply this process to ALL skills after ANY failure to ensure continuous improvement and prevent drift.
