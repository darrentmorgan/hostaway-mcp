# PR #8 Lessons Learned - CI/CD Failures Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**PR**: #8 - "feat: add automated MCP migration system with deployment validation"
**Status**: MERGED (despite failures)
**CI Run**: https://github.com/darrentmorgan/hostaway-mcp/actions/runs/18958408866

## Executive Summary

PR #8 merged successfully but encountered 2 critical CI failures that would have blocked deployment in stricter environments:

1. **Lint and Format Check** - FAILED
2. **Test Suite (integration)** - FAILED (5 tests with 500 errors)

This document captures the root causes and preventive measures for future PRs.

## Issue #1: Lint and Format Check Failure

### What Happened
**CI Log**:
```
Would reformat: tests/automation/test_dependency_resolver.py
Would reformat: tests/mcp/test_integration_all_fixes.py
Would reformat: tests/mcp/test_mcp_stdio_improvements.py
3 files would be reformatted, 117 files already formatted
Process completed with exit code 1.
```

### Root Cause
Three test files were committed without applying `ruff format`. The pre-commit hooks ran successfully locally, but the CI environment caught formatting discrepancies.

**Why Local Hooks Didn't Catch It**:
- Pre-commit hooks may have been bypassed with `--no-verify`
- Different file sets between local commit and CI check
- Hooks ran before final file modifications

### Prevention Strategy
**NEVER** rely solely on pre-commit hooks. Always run:

```bash
# Apply formatting (don't just check)
uv run ruff format src/ tests/

# Apply linting fixes
uv run ruff check src/ tests/ --fix

# Verify nothing remains
uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
```

**Updated Workflow**:
1. Make code changes
2. **Apply** ruff format/lint fixes
3. Run pre-commit hooks
4. **Verify** with --check flags
5. Commit
6. Push

## Issue #2: Integration Test Failures (500 Errors)

### What Happened
**CI Log**:
```
tests/integration/test_listings_summary.py::test_get_listings_with_summary_true FAILED
tests/integration/test_listings_summary.py::test_get_listings_without_summary_returns_full_response FAILED
tests/integration/test_listings_summary.py::test_get_listings_summary_false_returns_full_response FAILED
tests/integration/test_listings_summary.py::test_get_listings_summary_with_null_optional_fields FAILED
tests/integration/test_listings_summary.py::test_get_listings_summary_response_size_reduction FAILED

assert response.status_code == 200
E       assert 500 == 200
E        +  where 500 = <Response [500 Internal Server Error]>.status_code
```

### Root Cause
The integration tests were testing a **summary** feature that came from the base branch (`001-we-need-to`) during the merge. The feature implementation has server-side issues causing 500 errors.

**Key Finding**: These tests weren't part of our original automation PR - they were merged in from the base branch.

### Prevention Strategy

**Before Creating PR**:
```bash
# ALWAYS run integration tests locally
uv run pytest tests/integration -v --no-cov

# Check for 500 errors specifically
uv run pytest tests/integration -v --no-cov 2>&1 | grep "500 == 200"
```

**After Merging Base Branch**:
```bash
# Re-run integration tests
uv run pytest tests/integration -v --no-cov

# If failures found, investigate BEFORE pushing
```

**Updated Workflow**:
1. Before creating PR: Run full integration test suite
2. After merging base branch: Re-validate integration tests
3. If 500 errors found: Investigate server-side issues
4. Fix or skip failing tests with pytest marks
5. Document why tests are skipped

## Issue #3: CI vs Local Environment Differences

### What Happened
Local validation passed, but CI caught issues that weren't visible locally.

### Root Causes
1. **Different Python environments** (local vs CI)
2. **Different file change detection** (git worktree state)
3. **Timing** - CI checks ran on code before final formatting
4. **Merge timing** - Base branch changes introduced new test files mid-PR

### Prevention Strategy

**Simulate CI Locally**:
```bash
# Clean environment check
git stash
uv sync --force
uv run pytest tests/integration -v --no-cov
git stash pop
```

**Check CI Workflow Locally**:
```bash
# Mimic CI steps from .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
uv run mypy src/ --config-file=pyproject.toml
uv run pytest tests/unit -v
uv run pytest tests/integration -v --no-cov
uv run bandit -r src/ -ll -q
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Validation Script
Created `.automation/scripts/pre-pr-validate.sh`:

**Features**:
- **Applies** formatting/linting fixes (not just checks)
- **Runs** integration tests to catch 500 errors
- **Verifies** all checks pass before allowing PR
- **Reports** specific issues (formatting files, 500 errors, etc.)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Apply fixes and validate
.automation/scripts/pre-pr-validate.sh

# Check-only mode (no fixes)
.automation/scripts/pre-pr-validate.sh --check-only
```

### 2. Updated Deploy Validator Skill
Updated `~/.claude/skills/deploy-validator.md`:

**Critical Learnings Added**:
1. Format ALL files before commit (apply, don't just check)
2. Run integration tests locally to catch 500 errors
3. Validate merged changes from base branch
4. Check CI logs for exact failure points

### 3. Documentation
Created this document to preserve lessons learned.

## Best Practices Going Forward

### Pre-Commit Checklist

```bash
# 1. Format & Lint (APPLY, not check)
uv run ruff format src/ tests/
uv run ruff check src/ tests/ --fix

# 2. Verify Clean
uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/
uv run ruff check src/ tests/

# 3. Run Tests
uv run pytest tests/unit -v                     # Fast feedback
uv run pytest tests/integration -v --no-cov    # Catch 500 errors
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term      # Coverage

# 4. Security & Type Checking
uv run mypy src/
uv run bandit -r src/ -ll -q

# 5. Run Enhanced Validation
.automation/scripts/pre-pr-validate.sh
```

### Post-Merge Checklist

```bash
# 1. Pull latest base branch
git fetch origin 001-we-need-to

# 2. Merge
git merge origin/001-we-need-to

# 3. RE-VALIDATE
.automation/scripts/pre-pr-validate.sh

# 4. Fix any new failures from merged code
```

### CI Debugging Checklist

If CI fails but local passes:

1. **Check CI logs** - Exact error messages
2. **Simulate CI environment** - Clean uv sync
3. **Check file state** - What files were actually committed?
4. **Check merge timing** - Did base branch merge introduce new tests?
5. **Run enhanced validation** - `.automation/scripts/pre-pr-validate.sh`

## Conclusion

**Key Takeaway**: Pre-commit hooks and local validation are necessary but not sufficient. Always:

1. **APPLY** formatting/linting fixes, don't just check
2. **RUN** integration tests locally to catch 500 errors
3. **RE-VALIDATE** after merging base branch changes
4. **SIMULATE** CI environment locally when possible

By following these practices, we can ensure PR #8's failures never happen again.

**Next PR Goal**: 100% CI pass rate with zero formatting/lint/test failures.
