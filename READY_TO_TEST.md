- `organization_members` - Membership with role='owner'
- `hostaway_credentials` - Encrypted credentials
- `api_keys` - Your generated API keys (SHA-256 hashed)

### Check Logs
```bash
# Next.js logs (in terminal where you ran npm run dev)
# FastAPI logs (shows in application startup)
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue**: "Port 3000 is in use"
**Fix**: Dashboard is on port 3001 instead (already handled)

**Issue**: Docker not running
**Fix**: Already started Docker and Supabase for you

**Issue**: FastAPI startup error about email-validator
**Fix**: Already installed email-validator package

**Issue**: Hostaway validation fails
**Check**: Credentials are valid on https://dashboard.hostaway.com

## 🔄 Restart Services

If needed, restart any service:

```bash
# FastAPI (from project root)
uv run uvicorn src.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# Next.js (from dashboard/)
cd dashboard && npm run dev

# Supabase
supabase stop
supabase start
```
