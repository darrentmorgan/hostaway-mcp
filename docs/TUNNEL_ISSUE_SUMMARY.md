# Cloudflare Tunnel Issue - Quick Summary

**Issue**: `https://mcp.baliluxurystays.com` returns SSL handshake failure
**Root Cause**: Public Hostname not configured in Cloudflare Zero Trust
**Status**: Waiting for manual configuration in Cloudflare dashboard

## What's Working ✅

```
[User's Browser]
        ↓
[DNS Resolution] ✅ mcp.baliluxurystays.com → tunnel CNAME
        ↓
[Cloudflare Edge] ❌ NO PUBLIC HOSTNAME CONFIGURED
```

```
[VPS: 72.60.233.157]
        ↓
[Cloudflare Tunnel Daemon] ✅ Connected (4 edge connections)
        ↓
[Ingress Rules] ✅ Loaded correctly
        ↓
[Docker: hostaway-mcp] ✅ Healthy on localhost:8080
        ↓
[FastAPI MCP Server] ✅ Responding to requests
```

## What's Missing ❌

### The Gap in Cloudflare's Edge

```
User Request (HTTPS)
    ↓
Cloudflare Edge Servers
    │
    ├─ DNS: "Where is mcp.baliluxurystays.com?"
    │   → "It's at tunnel 5f107579...cfargotunnel.com" ✅
    │
    ├─ SSL: "Do I have a certificate for mcp.baliluxurystays.com?"
    │   → "NO! I don't know this hostname" ❌
    │
    └─ Routing: "Which tunnel should I send this to?"
        → "UNKNOWN! No Public Hostname configured" ❌
```

---

## The Fix (3 Steps)

### 1. Go to Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard
https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/ → **Access** → **Tunnels**

### 2. Select Your Tunnel
Click on tunnel: `5f107579-fe2f-4851-8707-34d97f1ef6e9`

### 3. Add Public Hostname
Click **Public Hostname** tab → **Add a public hostname**

```
Subdomain: mcp
Domain: baliluxurystays.com
Type: HTTP
URL: localhost:8080
```

Click **Save**

## Why This Happened

### Tunnel Migration Process

**What the migration DID transfer**:
- ✅ Ingress rules (internal tunnel routing)
- ✅ Tunnel credentials
- ✅ Tunnel configuration

**What the migration DID NOT transfer**:
- ❌ Public Hostname entries (external edge routing)
- ❌ SSL certificate provisioning
- ❌ Edge server routing tables

### Result
The tunnel knows how to route traffic internally, but Cloudflare's edge doesn't know to send traffic TO the tunnel.

## Verification Tests

### Before Fix (Current State)
```bash
# DNS works
dig +short mcp.baliluxurystays.com
# → 5f107579-fe2f-4851-8707-34d97f1ef6e9.cfargotunnel.com. ✅

# SSL fails
curl https://mcp.baliluxurystays.com/health
# → SSL handshake failure ❌

# No traffic in tunnel logs
journalctl -u cloudflared -f
# → Zero requests logged ❌
```

### After Fix (Expected State)
```bash
# DNS still works
dig +short mcp.baliluxurystays.com
# → 5f107579-fe2f-4851-8707-34d97f1ef6e9.cfargotunnel.com. ✅

# SSL works
curl https://mcp.baliluxurystays.com/health
# → {"status":"healthy",...} ✅

# Traffic visible in logs
journalctl -u cloudflared -f
# → GET /health HTTP/1.1 200 OK ✅
```
