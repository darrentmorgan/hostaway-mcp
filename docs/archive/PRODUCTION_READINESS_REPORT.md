## Test Coverage Analysis

### Achieved Coverage: 72.80%

**Breakdown by Component**:

| Component | Coverage | Quality |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Core Logic (auth, rate limit, retry) | 85-100% | ✅ Excellent |
| Data Models (Pydantic) | 100% | ✅ Excellent |
| Service Layer (HostawayClient) | 88% | ✅ Good |
| Route Handlers (API endpoints) | 34-66% | ⚠️ Acceptable |
| MCP Integration | 90% | ✅ Good |

**Compensating Controls**:
- ✅ 29 integration tests cover endpoint behavior
- ✅ 4 E2E tests validate complete workflows
- ✅ 11 performance tests validate load handling
- ✅ Strong type safety (mypy --strict)
- ✅ Pydantic input validation on all routes

**Documented Exception**: See COVERAGE_EXCEPTION.md for full rationale and approval

---

## Performance Validation

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Authentication Time | <5s | 0.66s | ✅ **8x better** |
| API Response Time | <2s | 0.77s | ✅ **2.6x better** |
| Concurrent Requests | 100+ | ✅ Tested | ✅ Pass |
| Rate Limit Compliance | Zero violations | ✅ Enforced | ✅ Pass |
| MCP Tool Overhead | <1s | <1s | ✅ Pass |

**Result**: All performance benchmarks **EXCEEDED**

---

## Security Posture

| Security Control | Implementation | Validation |
|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| Credential Storage | Environment variables only | ✅ No secrets in code |
| Input Validation | Pydantic Field constraints | ✅ All inputs validated |
| Authentication | OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials | ✅ Token-based |
| Audit Logging | Correlation IDs + structured JSON | ✅ Full request tracing |
| Rate Limiting | 15 req/10s IP, 20 req/10s account | ✅ Client-side enforced |
| HTTPS Transport | TLS required (via reverse proxy) | ✅ Production config |
| Error Sanitization | No credential/PII leakage | ✅ Verified |

**Security Audit**: Zero critical or high-severity issues (Bandit scan clean)

- [ ] TLS/SSL certificate configuration - deployment environment-specific

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Documented for v1.0

1. **Test Coverage at 72.80%**
   - **Impact**: Low - route handlers are simple pass-through
   - **Mitigation**: E2E tests + type safety + input validation
   - **Resolution**: Increase to 80% in v1.1
   - **Reference**: COVERAGE_EXCEPTION.md

2. **Guest Communication (US4) Not Implemented**
   - **Impact**: Medium - manual guest messaging required
   - **Mitigation**: Existing communication channels remain functional
   - **Resolution**: Implement in v1.1 with test environment
   - **Reference**: PROJECT_STATUS.md §Phase 6

3. **Partial Failure Handling (FR-013) Deferred**
   - **Impact**: Low - batch operations not in v1.0 scope
   - **Mitigation**: Single operations fail gracefully
   - **Resolution**: Implement in v1.1 if needed
   - **Reference**: tasks.md §T029a-T029e

### Resolved Ambiguities

All specification ambiguities resolved in AMBIGUITY_RESOLUTIONS.md:
- ✅ "User context" in audit logging → Defined log fields
- ✅ "Routine guest communication" → Explicit categorization
- ✅ "Property" vs "Listing" terminology → Standardized on "Listing"

---
