# Calculated Financial Reports - Implementation Summary

## Problem

The Hostaway `/financialReports` API endpoint is not available for your account (returns 404). This is likely due to:
- Account tier limitations (premium/enterprise feature)
- Feature not enabled in Hostaway dashboard
- API version mismatch

## Solution

Implemented a **calculated fallback system** that computes financial reports from reservation data when the native Hostaway API is unavailable.

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Fallback
When the financial endpoint is called:
1. **First**: Try native Hostaway `/financialReports` API
2. **If 404**: Automatically fall back to calculated reports from reservations
3. **If other error**: Return appropriate error with correlation ID

### 2. Data Fetching (Context Window Protection)
```python
# Fetch up to 1000 reservations in batches of 200
for offset in range(0, 1000, 200):
    batch = await client.search_bookings(limit=200, offset=offset)
    all_reservations.extend(batch)
    if len(batch) < 200:
        break  # Last page
```

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- Maximum 1000 reservations per request
- Batch fetching (200 at a time)
- Only returns aggregated summaries (not full reservation details)
- Filters by date range to minimize data

### 3. Financial Calculation

**From Reservation Data**:
```python
# Revenue
total_revenue = sum(totalPrice)
cleaning_fees = sum(cleaningFee)
taxes = sum(taxAmount)

# Expenses
channel_commissions = sum(channelCommissionAmount)
hostaway_commissions = sum(hostawayCommissionAmount)
total_expenses = channel_commissions + hostaway_commissions

# Profitability
net_income = total_revenue - total_expenses
profit_margin = (net_income / total_revenue) * 100

# Metrics
total_bookings = count(reservations)
total_nights = sum(nights)
average_daily_rate = total_revenue / total_nights
average_booking_value = total_revenue / total_bookings
```

**Filters Applied**:
- Date range: Overlap with report period (arrivalDate to departureDate)
- Status: Excludes cancelled, declined, pending, inquiry bookings
- Only confirmed revenue bookings included

### 4. Revenue by Channel
Breaks down revenue by booking source:
- `airbnbOfficial` - Airbnb bookings
- `vrbo` - VRBO bookings
- `direct` - Direct bookings
- etc.

## Example Response

```json
{
  "period": {
    "startDate": "2025-10-01",
    "endDate": "2025-10-31"
  },
  "currency": "IDR",
  "revenue": {
    "totalRevenue": 118212671.4,
    "cleaningFees": 1100000.0,
    "taxes": 0.0,
    "byChannel": {
      "airbnbOfficial": 118212671.4
    }
  },
  "expenses": {
    "totalExpenses": 0.0,
    "channelCommissions": 0.0,
    "hostawayCommissions": 0.0
  },
  "profitability": {
    "netIncome": 118212671.4,
    "profitMargin": 100.0
  },
  "metrics": {
    "totalBookings": 4,
    "totalNights": 40,
    "averageDailyRate": 2955316.78,
    "averageBookingValue": 29553167.85
  },
  "dataSource": "calculated_from_reservations",
  "note": "This report is calculated from reservation data as the Hostaway financial reports API is not available for your account."
}
```

## Files Created

1. **src/services/financial_calculator.py**
   - `FinancialCalculator` class
   - `calculate_financial_report()` - Aggregate reports
   - `calculate_property_financials()` - Property-specific reports

2. **src/api/routes/financial.py** (Modified)
   - Added `_calculate_financial_report()` helper function
   - Updated exception handling for automatic fallback
   - Removed duplicate exception handlers

3. **deploy-to-hostinger-secure.sh** (Fixed)
   - Corrected deployment path to `/opt/hostaway-mcp`
   - Updated to use `docker-compose.prod.yml`

## Limitations

**Data Availability**:
- Commission data may be `null` in reservations (resulting in $0 expenses)
- Tax data may be `null`
- Security deposit data may be `null`

**Context Window**:
- Limited to 1000 reservations per request
- If you have more bookings, older ones won't be included in calculations
- Recommend filtering by date range (1-3 months at a time)

## Usage

### Via API

```bash
# Get financial report for date range
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "http://72.60.233.157:8080/api/financialReports?start_date=2025-10-01&end_date=2025-10-31"

# Get property-specific report
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "http://72.60.233.157:8080/api/financialReports?start_date=2025-10-01&end_date=2025-10-31&listing_id=400569"
```

### Via Test Agent

```bash
uv run python test_api_agent.py
```

## Benefits
