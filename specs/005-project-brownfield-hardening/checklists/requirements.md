- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: Spec focuses on pagination, summarization, and token budgets without mentioning specific technologies. Dependencies section notes "Redis/similar" and "Prometheus/StatsD/CloudWatch" as examples only, not requirements.

✅ **User value focused**: Each user story clearly articulates why it matters and what value it delivers to Claude workflows and engineering teams.

✅ **Non-technical language**: Spec is readable by product managers and business stakeholders. Technical concepts (cursors, tokens, chunking) are explained in business terms.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections present with substantial content.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarification markers**: Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the spec. All decisions have documented reasonable defaults.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Every FR has measurable acceptance criteria:
- FR-001: "all list/search endpoints that can return more than 50 items" - testable by data size
- FR-002: "default: 50, maximum: 200" - specific numeric limits
- FR-010: "when estimated response exceeds configured token threshold (default: 4000 tokens)" - specific threshold
- All requirements use "MUST" with concrete conditions

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: 8 success criteria with specific metrics:
- SC-001: "99.9% of sessions" - quantitative
- SC-002: "reduces by 60%" with baseline "~6000 tokens to ~2400 tokens" - quantitative
- SC-003: "95% of list endpoints within 2 weeks" - quantitative with timeline
- SC-006: "within 5 minutes (vs 30+ minutes currently)" - time-based with baseline

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: All SC items focus on user outcomes:
- "Claude workflows complete tasks without errors" (not "API returns 200 status")
- "token usage per response reduces by 60%" (not "Redis cache hit rate improves")
- "Support tickets decrease by 80%" (business outcome, not technical metric)

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: 5 user stories with 16 total acceptance scenarios covering:
- Pagination (4 scenarios)
- Summarization (4 scenarios)
- Configuration (4 scenarios)
- Chunking (4 scenarios)
- Telemetry (4 scenarios)

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 6 edge cases documented with clear handling strategies:
- Invalid cursors
- Malformed parameters
- Token estimation errors
- Unsummarizable data types
- Rapid pagination
- Real-time data changes

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**:
- In-Scope: 7 capabilities listed with clear descriptions
- Non-Goals: 4 items explicitly excluded
- Out of Scope: 7 items deferred or excluded

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions**:
- 10 documented assumptions (JSON serialization, Claude Desktop support, etc.)
- 5 dependencies listed (token estimation, config management, metrics, cursor storage, server framework)

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Functional requirements with acceptance criteria**: All 36 functional requirements are written as testable assertions with clear pass/fail conditions.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 5 prioritized user stories cover:
- P1: Pagination (most common overflow cause)
- P1: Summarization (per-item verbosity)
- P2: Configuration (operational flexibility)
- P2: Chunking (large content handling)
- P3: Telemetry (observability)

Priorities reflect value and dependency order - P1 items are foundation for P2/P3.

✅ **Measurable outcomes match success criteria**: Success criteria directly measure user story value:
- Story 1 (Pagination) → SC-003 (95% pagination adoption)
- Story 2 (Summarization) → SC-002 (60% token reduction)
- Story 3 (Configuration) → (implicit in SC-003 via rollout)
- Story 5 (Telemetry) → SC-006 (5min diagnostics vs 30min)

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Spec maintains abstraction throughout. When examples are given (Redis, Prometheus), they're clearly marked as examples, not requirements.

## Notes

**Specification is READY for planning phase.**

All validation criteria pass. The specification is comprehensive, testable, and focused on business value without implementation details. No clarifications needed - all decisions have reasonable documented defaults.

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization of user stories enables incremental delivery
- Extensive functional requirements (36) provide comprehensive coverage
- Success criteria are measurable and include baselines for comparison
- Edge cases and risks are thoroughly documented with mitigations
- Backwards compatibility requirements ensure safe brownfield deployment

Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan.
