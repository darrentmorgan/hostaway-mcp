# Feature Specification: Multi-Tenant Billable MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `003-we-need-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Validated âœ…
**Input**: User description: "we need to build out the mcp so that end users can connect their own account, we need metrics and billing with stripe and a simple dashboard where they can get their api key. we need a model where we bill per listing. this will be a billable mcp server for hosts to use ai against their hostaway account to perform listing creation, updates, financial analysis and more as we add more endpoints."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Hostaway Account Connection & Authentication (Priority: P1)

Property managers need to securely connect their own Hostaway credentials to the MCP server so they can use AI-powered tools against their specific Hostaway account data without sharing credentials with other users.

**Why this priority**: Without multi-tenant account isolation, the system cannot serve multiple users. This is the foundation for all other features and delivers immediate value by allowing users to authenticate their own accounts.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by registering a new user, connecting their Hostaway account (OAuth or API credentials), and verifying isolation - user A cannot access user B's data. Delivers value by securing multi-tenant access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new property manager visits the dashboard, **When** they sign up and connect their Hostaway account ID and secret key, **Then** the system stores encrypted credentials scoped to their user account and validates credentials by making a test API call to Hostaway
2. **Given** a user has connected their Hostaway account, **When** they make MCP tool calls using their API key, **Then** the system uses their specific Hostaway credentials for all API requests and returns only their property data
3. **Given** two users (User A and User B) have connected different Hostaway accounts, **When** User A makes an MCP request, **Then** the system never exposes User B's data or credentials to User A

---

### User Story 2 - API Key Management & Dashboard Access (Priority: P2)

Users need a simple web dashboard where they can generate, view, and regenerate their MCP API keys so they can configure their AI agents to access the billable MCP server.

**Why this priority**: After account connection (P1), users need a way to get API keys to actually use the service. This enables self-service onboarding and delivers immediate value by letting users configure AI tools.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging into dashboard, generating an API key, copying it, and successfully using it in an MCP client (Claude Desktop). Delivers value by enabling self-service access without manual intervention.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged into the dashboard, **When** they navigate to the API Keys section, **Then** the system displays a "Generate API Key" button and any existing active keys (masked, showing only last 4 characters)
2. **Given** a user clicks "Generate API Key", **When** the key is created, **Then** the system displays the full key once (with a "Copy" button) and warns "Store this securely - you won't see it again"
3. **Given** a user has an active API key, **When** they click "Regenerate", **Then** the system invalidates the old key, generates a new one, and displays a confirmation that the old key will stop working immediately
4. **Given** a user wants to revoke access, **When** they delete an API key, **Then** the system immediately invalidates the key and any subsequent MCP requests using that key return 401 Unauthorized

---

### User Story 3 - Per-Listing Billing with Stripe (Priority: P3)

Users are billed monthly based on the number of active listings in their Hostaway account, with automatic metering via Stripe subscriptions, so they pay fairly for the resources they consume without manual invoicing.

**Why this priority**: After users can connect accounts (P1) and get API keys (P2), billing enables monetization. This is the revenue model foundation but can be implemented after core functionality is proven.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by connecting a Hostaway account with 5 listings, verifying Stripe subscription is created with quantity=5, adding 2 listings to Hostaway, and confirming Stripe subscription updates to quantity=7 with prorated charges. Delivers value by automating billing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user connects their Hostaway account with 10 active listings, **When** they complete onboarding, **Then** the system creates a Stripe subscription with quantity=10 and bills them $X per listing per month (e.g., $5/listing/month = $50/month)
2. **Given** a user's listing count changes (they add or remove listings in Hostaway), **When** the system's daily sync job runs, **Then** Stripe subscription quantity updates automatically and prorated charges/credits are applied to the next invoice
3. **Given** a user's payment fails, **When** Stripe webhook notifies payment failure, **Then** the system suspends their API key access and sends email notification with payment retry instructions
4. **Given** a user wants to cancel, **When** they click "Cancel Subscription" in the dashboard, **Then** Stripe subscription is canceled at period end and the user retains access until the billing cycle completes

---

### User Story 4 - Usage Metrics & Monitoring Dashboard (Priority: P4)

Users need visibility into their API usage, listing count, and billing history via a dashboard so they can monitor costs, track AI tool usage, and validate billing accuracy.

**Why this priority**: After billing is active (P3), users need transparency for trust and cost management. This is a quality-of-life feature that reduces support burden but isn't critical for launch.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making 100 MCP API calls, viewing the dashboard, and verifying metrics show 100 requests, current listing count, current month's projected bill, and past invoices. Delivers value by providing cost visibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged into the dashboard, **When** they view the Usage tab, **Then** the system displays current month's API request count, current active listing count, projected bill for current month, and a 30-day request volume chart
2. **Given** a user wants to audit billing, **When** they view the Billing History section, **Then** the system displays past Stripe invoices with date, listing count, amount charged, and payment status
3. **Given** a user's listing count is shown as 15 but they believe it's incorrect, **When** they click "Sync Now", **Then** the system immediately fetches latest listing count from Hostaway API and updates the display

---

### User Story 5 - AI-Powered Listing Operations via MCP (Priority: P5)

Users can perform listing creation, updates, and financial analysis via AI agents using MCP tools, with all operations scoped to their authenticated Hostaway account, enabling scalable property management automation.

**Why this priority**: This is the value-add feature that differentiates the service, but it builds on all previous infrastructure (P1-P4). Can be incrementally added as new MCP endpoints are developed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by connecting a test Hostaway account, using Claude Desktop with the MCP server to create a new listing via natural language ("Create a 2-bedroom listing in Miami"), and verifying the listing appears in Hostaway under the correct account. Delivers value by enabling AI-powered property management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has configured their AI agent with their MCP API key, **When** they ask "Create a new 3-bedroom listing in Austin, TX", **Then** the AI agent uses the create_listing MCP tool with the user's Hostaway credentials and the listing appears in their Hostaway account
2. **Given** a user wants to update pricing across all listings, **When** they ask "Increase all nightly rates by 10%", **Then** the AI agent uses batch_update_listings MCP tool and confirms updates for each listing with success/failure status
3. **Given** a user wants financial insights, **When** they ask "What's my total revenue this month?", **Then** the AI agent uses get_financial_summary MCP tool and returns revenue broken down by listing with booking counts and average nightly rate

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a user's Hostaway credentials expire or are revoked?** System detects 401 errors from Hostaway API, marks account as "Credentials Invalid", suspends MCP API access, and sends email prompting credential re-entry
- **How does the system handle listing count discrepancies (Hostaway shows 10, Stripe subscription shows 8)?** Daily sync job reconciles counts, updates Stripe subscription quantity with proration, and logs discrepancy for audit trail
- **What if a user connects multiple Hostaway accounts?** System supports 1:1 user-to-Hostaway-account mapping initially; multi-account support requires account switching UI (future enhancement)
- **How are deleted listings handled for billing?** Daily sync job detects listing deletions via Hostaway API, reduces Stripe subscription quantity, applies prorated credit to next invoice
- **What happens when Stripe subscription payment fails after retries?** After final retry failure (per Stripe retry logic), system suspends API key access, archives user data, sends cancellation notice with 30-day data retention policy
- **How does the system handle API rate limits across multiple tenants?** Each user's MCP requests count against their Hostaway account's rate limit (20 req/10s); system tracks per-user rate limit state and returns 429 with retry-after guidance when limits are hit
- **What if a user generates 100 API keys?** System limits to 5 active API keys per user; attempting to generate 6th key requires deleting an existing key first
- **How are partial failures handled in batch listing operations?** Uses PartialFailureResponse pattern from v1.1 - returns successful operations alongside detailed failure info with remediation guidance

## Technical Architecture *(decided)*

### Tech Stack

**Database & Auth: Supabase**
- PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenancy
- Supabase Auth for user authentication (email/password, OAuth providers)
- Supabase Vault (pgsodium) for Hostaway credential encryption
- Edge Functions for Stripe webhook handling
- MCP integration available for schema management during development

**Frontend: Vercel + Next.js**
- Next.js 14 with App Router for dashboard UI
- Server Components for data fetching from Supabase
- Server Actions for Stripe operations
- Deployed on Vercel (edge runtime for API routes)

**Backend: FastAPI MCP Server (Existing)**
- Continues to handle MCP tool operations
- Validates X-API-Key against Supabase database
- Fetches organization's Hostaway credentials from Supabase
- Proxies authenticated requests to Hostaway API

**Billing: Stripe**
- Subscription-based billing with per-listing metering
- Webhooks handled by Supabase Edge Functions
- Customer portal for payment management

### Multi-Tenancy Strategy

**Row Level Security (RLS) Enforcement:**
```sql
-- All tables use RLS to enforce organization isolation
-- Policies automatically filter data by user's organization_id
-- Database-level security (cannot be bypassed by application code)
```

**Data Isolation Flow:**
1. User authenticates via Supabase Auth â†’ gets JWT with user_id
2. Application queries organizations table â†’ RLS policy filters by user's org membership
3. All child tables (api_keys, subscriptions, etc.) filtered by organization_id
4. Zero trust: even compromised application code cannot access other orgs' data

### Security Architecture

**Authentication Layers:**
- **Dashboard Access**: Supabase Auth JWT tokens (session-based)
- **MCP Tool Access**: X-API-Key header (static keys for Claude Desktop)

**Credential Storage:**
- Hostaway account credentials encrypted using Supabase Vault (pgsodium)
- Encryption keys managed by Supabase (hardware security module backed)
- Decryption only happens in backend FastAPI when validating MCP requests

**Audit Trail:**
- All MCP tool invocations logged with organization_id, user_id, tool_name, timestamp
- Supabase audit logs track dashboard access and data modifications

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

**Security & Compliance**
- **FR-020**: System MUST authenticate all MCP API requests using X-API-Key header validation against active API keys stored in Supabase
- **FR-021**: System MUST log all MCP tool invocations to Supabase with organization_id, tool name, timestamp, and success/failure status for audit trail
- **FR-022**: System MUST encrypt Hostaway credentials at rest using Supabase Vault and never log or expose them in API responses or error messages
- **FR-027**: System MUST use Supabase service role key in FastAPI backend to bypass RLS when validating API keys (read-only access to api_keys and hostaway_credentials tables)

### Key Entities (Supabase Schema)

**Managed by Supabase Auth** (auth schema):
- **auth.users**: User authentication data (id, email, encrypted_password, email_confirmed_at, last_sign_in_at) - managed by Supabase Auth

**Custom Application Tables** (public schema):
- **organizations**: Tenant entity with id (PK), name, owner_user_id (FK to auth.users), created_at, stripe_customer_id
- **organization_members**: Many-to-many relationship with organization_id, user_id (FK to auth.users), role (owner/admin/member), joined_at
