**Feature**: Multi-Tenant Billable MCP Server
**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Reviewer**: System validation

---

## Validation Criteria

### 1. No Implementation Details ✅ PASS

**Criteria**: Specification describes WHAT and WHY, not HOW

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Describes multi-tenant isolation requirement without specifying database schema
- ✅ Describes Stripe billing requirement without implementation details (no mention of specific libraries)
- ✅ Describes dashboard requirement without UI framework choice
- ✅ Describes API key management without cryptographic algorithm selection
- ✅ User stories focus on business value ("Property managers need to securely connect...") not technical solution

**Violations**: None

---

### 2. Testable Requirements ✅ PASS

**Criteria**: Each functional requirement includes verifiable criteria

**Evidence**:
- ✅ FR-001: "completely isolated from other users" - testable via concurrent user requests
- ✅ FR-002: "encrypted at rest using AES-256" - verifiable via security audit
- ✅ FR-003: "making a test API call" - testable via credential validation flow
- ✅ FR-009: "charged monthly per active listing" - verifiable via Stripe subscription inspection
- ✅ FR-020: "X-API-Key header validation" - testable via API authentication tests
- ✅ All 22 functional requirements include MUST/SHOULD verbs with measurable criteria

**Violations**: None

---

### 3. Measurable Success Criteria ✅ PASS

**Criteria**: All success criteria include specific metrics

**Evidence**:
- ✅ SC-001: "under 3 minutes" - time-based metric
- ✅ SC-002: "100% of MCP requests" - percentage-based isolation metric
- ✅ SC-003: "99.9% accuracy" - precision metric for billing
- ✅ SC-004: "within 5 minutes" - SLA metric for webhook handling
- ✅ SC-005: "under 1 second (p95)" - latency metric with percentile
- ✅ SC-007: "under 30 seconds for accounts with up to 500 listings" - bounded performance metric
- ✅ SC-008: "1000 concurrent requests across 100 users" - load metric
- ✅ SC-009: "80% reduction" - improvement metric
- ✅ SC-010: "95% success rate" - reliability metric

**Violations**: None

---

### 4. User-Centric Language ✅ PASS

**Criteria**: Written from user perspective, not developer perspective

**Evidence**:
- ✅ User Story 1: "Property managers need to securely connect their own Hostaway credentials..."
- ✅ User Story 2: "Users need a simple web dashboard where they can generate..."
- ✅ User Story 3: "Users are billed monthly based on the number of active listings..."
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format with user actions
- ✅ Edge cases describe user impact ("System detects 401 errors... and sends email prompting credential re-entry")

**Violations**: None

---

### 5. Prioritized User Stories ✅ PASS

**Criteria**: Stories ordered by importance with independent testability

**Evidence**:
- ✅ P1 (Account Connection): Foundation for multi-tenancy - critical
- ✅ P2 (API Key Management): Enables MCP access - necessary after P1
- ✅ P3 (Billing): Revenue model - can launch without initially, add later
- ✅ P4 (Usage Metrics): Quality of life - enhances trust but not MVP
- ✅ P5 (AI Operations): Value-add features - incremental additions

**Independent Testability**:
- ✅ P1 standalone: Register user, connect account, verify isolation (viable MVP)
- ✅ P2 standalone: Generate API key, use in MCP client (valuable without billing)
- ✅ P3 standalone: Connect account, verify Stripe subscription created (billing MVP)
- ✅ P4 standalone: View dashboard metrics without full billing (monitoring MVP)
- ✅ P5 standalone: Use single MCP tool for listing creation (AI feature demo)

**Violations**: None

---

### 6. Edge Cases Addressed ✅ PASS

**Criteria**: Critical edge cases and failure scenarios documented

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Credential expiration: "System detects 401 errors from Hostaway API, marks account as 'Credentials Invalid'"
- ✅ Listing count discrepancies: "Daily sync job reconciles counts, updates Stripe subscription quantity with proration"
- ✅ Payment failures: "After final retry failure... system suspends API key access, archives user data"
- ✅ Rate limit handling: "Each user's MCP requests count against their Hostaway account's rate limit"
- ✅ API key limits: "System limits to 5 active API keys per user"
- ✅ Partial failures: "Uses PartialFailureResponse pattern from v1.1"
- ✅ Multi-account scenario: "System supports 1:1 user-to-Hostaway-account mapping initially"
- ✅ Deleted listings: "Daily sync job detects listing deletions via Hostaway API, reduces Stripe subscription quantity"

**Violations**: None

---

### 7. Security & Privacy Considerations ✅ PASS

**Criteria**: Addresses authentication, authorization, data protection

**Evidence**:
- ✅ FR-002: "encrypted at rest using AES-256"
- ✅ FR-004: "User A can never access User B's Hostaway data"
- ✅ FR-020: "X-API-Key header validation against active user API keys"
- ✅ FR-021: "log all MCP tool invocations with user ID... for audit trail"
- ✅ FR-022: "never log or expose them in API responses or error messages"
- ✅ User Story 1 Scenario 3: "system never exposes User B's data or credentials to User A"
- ✅ Edge case: "30-day data retention policy" after account closure

**Violations**: None

---

### 8. Dependencies & Constraints ✅ PASS

**Criteria**: External dependencies and technical constraints identified

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Stripe integration dependency (FR-009 to FR-013)
- ✅ Hostaway API dependency (FR-003, FR-010, FR-016)
- ✅ Performance constraints: SC-005 (1s dashboard), SC-007 (30s sync for 500 listings)
- ✅ Scale constraints: SC-008 (1000 concurrent requests, 100 users)
- ✅ API key limit: FR-007 (max 5 active keys per user)
- ✅ Backward compatibility: Builds on v1.0/v1.1 MCP tools (FR-017)

**Violations**: None

---

### 9. Ambiguity Analysis ✅ PASS

**Criteria**: No undefined terms or unclear requirements

**Evidence**:
- ✅ "Multi-tenant" defined via isolation requirements (FR-001, FR-004)
- ✅ "Per-listing billing" clarified with example ($5/listing/month) in FR-009
- ✅ "Dashboard" scope defined in FR-005 (API key management) and FR-014 (usage metrics)
- ✅ "API key" lifecycle fully specified (generate, view masked, regenerate, delete) in FR-005 to FR-008
- ✅ "Listing count sync" mechanism clarified (daily job, manual "Sync Now") in FR-010, FR-016
- ✅ "Payment failure" handling flow detailed in FR-012 and edge cases
- ✅ "Active listing" defined implicitly (counted by Hostaway API sync)

**Potential Ambiguities**: None requiring clarification before planning

---

### 10. Completeness Check ✅ PASS

**Evidence**:
- ✅ User Scenarios & Testing: 5 prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios
- ✅ Edge Cases: 8 critical edge cases documented with resolution strategies

## Status: ✅ VALIDATED - READY FOR PLANNING

**Recommendation**: Specification is complete, testable, and technology-agnostic. No critical ambiguities or gaps identified. Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning.

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization with independently testable user stories (P1 to P5)
2. Comprehensive security coverage (encryption, isolation, audit logging)
3. Well-defined billing model with edge case handling
4. Measurable success criteria with specific metrics (time, accuracy, throughput)
5. Builds on existing v1.0/v1.1 architecture (PartialFailureResponse pattern)

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
2. Research Stripe subscription API and webhook handling
3. Design multi-tenant database schema
4. Create API contracts for dashboard endpoints
