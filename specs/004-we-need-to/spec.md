# Feature Specification: Production-Ready Dashboard with Design System

**Feature Branch**: `004-we-need-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we need to create a functional dashboard. we should install shad cn and tailwind for this. also the usage page is broken. these are crucial for production deployment"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Dashboard Visual Polish and Consistency (Priority: P1)

Property managers access a modern, professional dashboard interface with consistent styling, clear visual hierarchy, and polished UI components that match industry-standard SaaS applications.

**Why this priority**: Visual credibility is critical for production deployment. A broken or unprofessional UI undermines user trust and perceived product quality. This is the first impression users have of the platform.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to dashboard homepage - all pages load without visual errors, components render consistently with proper spacing and typography, navigation is intuitive and functional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user logs into dashboard, **When** navigating between pages (usage, billing, API keys, settings), **Then** all UI components render with consistent styling, proper spacing, and no broken layouts
2. **Given** user views dashboard on different screen sizes, **When** resizing browser window, **Then** layout adapts responsively without breaking or overlapping content
3. **Given** user interacts with forms and buttons, **When** clicking or hovering, **Then** visual feedback is clear with appropriate states (hover, active, disabled, loading)
4. **Given** user views data tables and cards, **When** content varies in length, **Then** components maintain visual consistency with proper truncation and spacing

### User Story 2 - Usage Page Functionality Restoration (Priority: P1)

Property managers view accurate API usage metrics, listing counts, and billing projections on a fully functional usage page that displays real-time data without errors.

**Why this priority**: The usage page is currently broken, blocking users from monitoring their usage and projected costs. This is critical business functionality that must work for production launch.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to /usage page - metrics load without errors, charts display historical data, projected bill calculates correctly based on listing count.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has made API requests this month, **When** viewing usage page, **Then** current month's API request count displays accurately
2. **Given** user has active Hostaway listings, **When** viewing usage page, **Then** listing count matches their Hostaway account and projected bill calculates correctly
3. **Given** user has historical usage data, **When** viewing usage chart, **Then** 30-day trend displays with proper axis labels and data points
4. **Given** user has not yet made any API requests, **When** viewing usage page, **Then** zero state displays with helpful guidance on getting started
5. **Given** data fails to load, **When** viewing usage page, **Then** error message displays with retry option instead of breaking the page

---

### User Story 3 - Reusable Component Library (Priority: P2)

Developers have access to a comprehensive library of pre-built, accessible UI components (buttons, cards, forms, modals, tables) that accelerate feature development while maintaining visual consistency.

**Why this priority**: A design system enables faster development of future features and ensures consistency across the application. While not blocking production launch, it significantly reduces technical debt.

**Independent Test**: Use component library to build a new dashboard page - components are documented, easy to integrate, and maintain consistent styling without custom CSS.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer needs to add a form, **When** using form components from the library, **Then** form renders with consistent validation, error states, and accessibility features
2. **Given** developer needs to display data, **When** using card and table components, **Then** components handle loading states, empty states, and error states automatically
3. **Given** developer needs user confirmation, **When** using modal/dialog components, **Then** modals are accessible (keyboard navigation, focus trap, ARIA labels)
4. **Given** developer needs consistent styling, **When** using design tokens (colors, spacing, typography), **Then** all components automatically inherit theme values

---

### User Story 4 - Dashboard Navigation and Structure (Priority: P2)

Property managers navigate effortlessly between dashboard sections (Home, Usage, Billing, API Keys, Settings) with clear visual indicators of current location and logical information architecture.

**Why this priority**: Good navigation is foundational to user experience but can be refined post-launch. Users can still complete tasks with basic navigation.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to each dashboard section - active section is visually indicated, breadcrumbs/navigation persist, user can return to previous sections without losing context.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on any dashboard page, **When** viewing navigation menu, **Then** current page is clearly highlighted and all sections are accessible
2. **Given** user navigates to a deep page (e.g., individual API key details), **When** viewing breadcrumbs, **Then** user can quickly return to parent sections
3. **Given** user has pending actions (e.g., missing credentials), **When** viewing navigation, **Then** visual indicators (badges, alerts) draw attention to relevant sections
4. **Given** user is on mobile device, **When** viewing navigation, **Then** menu collapses into mobile-friendly format with easy access to all sections

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user with no data views the usage page (zero state)?
- How does the dashboard handle extremely long organization names or listing counts above 1000?
- What happens when Supabase connection fails (error state recovery)?
- How does the UI adapt to users with browser accessibility features enabled (screen readers, high contrast mode)?
- What happens when API requests timeout while loading dashboard data?
- How does the dashboard handle users with multiple organizations (organization switching)?

## Assumptions

1. Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui are appropriate choices for the tech stack (industry-standard tools for Next.js applications)
2. The existing Next.js 15 and React 19 setup is stable and does not require downgrading
3. The usage page issue is related to missing UI components or styling, not backend data problems
4. Users expect a modern SaaS dashboard aesthetic similar to Vercel, Stripe, or Linear
5. Accessibility is a requirement for production deployment (not optional)
6. The dashboard will primarily be used on desktop (laptop/desktop) but must support mobile for on-the-go access
7. Dark mode is not required for initial production launch (can be added later)
8. The component library will follow Radix UI primitives (shadcn/ui's foundation) for accessibility and composability
9. The dashboard will use server components where possible for performance (Next.js App Router pattern)
10. Error boundaries are already implemented in Next.js layout (as seen in existing error.tsx files)

## Out of Scope

- Dark mode theme support (can be added in future iteration)
- Advanced data visualization (custom charts beyond basic line/bar charts)
- Real-time collaborative features (live cursors, presence indicators)
- Customizable dashboard layouts (drag-and-drop widgets, personalized views)
- Advanced data filtering and search (beyond basic sort/pagination)
- Multi-language internationalization (English only for initial launch)
- Mobile-specific native apps (responsive web only)
- Offline functionality (requires internet connection)
- Advanced analytics and reporting (exports, PDF generation)

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

- **shadcn/ui Component Library**: Pre-built accessible React components based on Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Radix UI Primitives**: Unstyled, accessible component primitives (foundation of shadcn/ui)
- **Next.js App Router**: Server components and routing system (already in use)
- **Supabase Client**: Data fetching for dashboard metrics (already integrated)

### Internal Dependencies

- **Existing Database Schema**: Usage metrics, subscriptions, organization data must exist and be queryable
- **Authentication System**: User must be authenticated to access dashboard (already implemented via Supabase Auth)
- **Backend API**: MCP server must be operational for usage tracking to populate metrics

### Blocking Dependencies

- **Usage Page Bug Fix**: The current broken state must be diagnosed before design system can be properly applied (P1 blocker)
- **Tailwind CSS Configuration**: Must be properly configured before shadcn/ui components can be installed
- **TypeScript Types**: Supabase database types must be generated for type-safe data fetching

## Risks

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: shadcn/ui compatibility with Next.js 15 and React 19 (bleeding edge versions)
  - **Mitigation**: Test installation on a branch first, check shadcn/ui compatibility docs, be prepared to downgrade Next.js if needed

- **Risk**: Usage page bug may be rooted in backend data issues, not just frontend
  - **Mitigation**: Diagnose root cause first (check browser console, network tab, Supabase logs) before applying UI fixes

- **Risk**: Component library adds significant bundle size
  - **Mitigation**: Use tree-shaking, only install needed components, measure bundle size impact with Next.js bundle analyzer

### User Experience Risks

- **Risk**: Design system changes may confuse existing users
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain similar information architecture and navigation patterns, only improve visual polish

- **Risk**: Over-engineering component library delays production launch
  - **Mitigation**: Start with minimal component set (Button, Card, Input, Table), expand post-launch as needed

### Deployment Risks

- **Risk**: New dependencies may cause build failures in production
  - **Mitigation**: Test full build process locally and in staging environment before production deployment

- **Risk**: Accessibility regressions introduced by new components
  - **Mitigation**: Run automated accessibility tests (Lighthouse, axe) in CI/CD pipeline, manual keyboard navigation testing

## Constraints

- **Time**: This feature is blocking production deployment, must be completed quickly (estimated 2-3 days for P1 stories)
- **Compatibility**: Must work with existing Next.js 15 and React 19 setup (no major framework changes)
- **Performance**: Dashboard must remain fast (page loads under 2 seconds, interactions under 100ms)
- **Accessibility**: Must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for production compliance
- **Browser Support**: Must work on latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (no IE11 support)
- **Mobile**: Must be responsive but mobile is secondary priority (desktop-first approach)

## Notes

### Why shadcn/ui?

shadcn/ui is not a traditional component library (npm package). Instead, it's a collection of copy-pasteable components built on Radix UI primitives. This gives us:

1. **Full ownership**: Components live in our codebase, fully customizable
2. **No dependency bloat**: Only includes components we actually use
3. **TypeScript-first**: Built with TypeScript, fully typed
4. **Accessibility**: Built on Radix UI (industry-leading accessibility)
5. **Tailwind CSS integration**: Works seamlessly with Tailwind's utility classes

### Current State Assessment

Based on examination of the existing dashboard:

- Next.js 15.5.4 with React 19.1.0 (latest versions)
- Basic Tailwind CSS already configured (globals.css exists)
- Dashboard pages exist but lack visual polish (basic HTML/CSS)
- Usage page has server components but needs UI refinement
- No component library currently in use (each page uses custom markup)

### Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1 (P1)**: Fix usage page + Install design system
   - Diagnose and fix usage page rendering issue
   - Install Tailwind CSS properly (may need reconfiguration)
   - Install shadcn/ui CLI and core components
   - Apply design system to existing pages

2. **Phase 2 (P2)**: Component library expansion
   - Create reusable component library
   - Improve navigation structure
   - Add loading/error/empty states

3. **Phase 3 (P3)**: Polish and optimization
   - Accessibility audit and fixes
   - Performance optimization
   - Mobile responsiveness refinements
