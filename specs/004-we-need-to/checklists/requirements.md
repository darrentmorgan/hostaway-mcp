# Specification Quality Checklist: Production-Ready Dashboard with Design System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status**: PASS - Specification focuses on user outcomes, not implementation
  - **Evidence**: Mentions shadcn/ui and Tailwind in context of user request but success criteria are technology-agnostic

- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status**: PASS - All user stories describe business value and user outcomes
  - **Evidence**: "Property managers access a modern, professional dashboard", "view accurate API usage metrics"

- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status**: PASS - Language is accessible, avoids technical jargon in requirements
  - **Evidence**: Requirements use clear business language like "Dashboard MUST display all pages without visual errors"

- [X] All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status**: PASS - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present and complete
  - **Evidence**: All template mandatory sections filled with substantive content

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **Status**: PASS - Zero clarification markers in the spec
  - **Evidence**: Full text search reveals no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers

- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status**: PASS - Each requirement has clear pass/fail criteria
  - **Evidence**: FR-001 "MUST display all pages without visual errors", FR-002 "MUST display current month's API request count"

- [X] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status**: PASS - All success criteria include specific metrics
  - **Evidence**: SC-001 "100% of pages render correctly", SC-002 "within 2 seconds", SC-006 "95% task completion rate"

- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status**: PASS - Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes, not technical implementations
  - **Evidence**: SC-001 focuses on "visual errors", not "React component errors" or "CSS bugs"

- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status**: PASS - Each user story has 4 Given-When-Then scenarios
  - **Evidence**: User Story 1 has 4 scenarios, User Story 2 has 5 scenarios

- [X] Edge cases are identified
  - **Status**: PASS - 6 edge cases listed covering zero states, errors, and extreme values
  - **Evidence**: "What happens when a user with no data views the usage page", "How does dashboard handle extremely long organization names"

- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status**: PASS - Out of Scope section explicitly excludes 9 features
  - **Evidence**: "Dark mode theme support", "Advanced data visualization", "Multi-language internationalization" all listed as out of scope

- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status**: PASS - 10 assumptions documented, dependencies section includes external, internal, and blocking deps
  - **Evidence**: Assumptions cover tech stack choices, Constraints section lists time/compatibility limits

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - Functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
  - **Evidence**: FR-002 (usage page metrics) → User Story 2, Scenario 1-2

- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status**: PASS - 4 user stories cover dashboard polish (P1), usage page fix (P1), component library (P2), navigation (P2)
  - **Evidence**: P1 stories are production blockers, P2 stories enhance developer experience

- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - 8 success criteria map directly to functional requirements and user stories
  - **Evidence**: SC-001 (pages render) → FR-001 (display pages), SC-002 (load time) → FR-004 (loading states)

- [X] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status**: PASS - Notes section explains tech choices (shadcn/ui rationale) but spec body remains implementation-agnostic
  - **Evidence**: Requirements use "Dashboard MUST" not "React component MUST", "Users can navigate" not "Next.js router MUST"

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:

- **Complete**: All mandatory sections filled with substantive content
- **Clear**: Requirements are testable, unambiguous, and written for non-technical stakeholders
- **Bounded**: Scope, dependencies, and assumptions clearly documented
- **Measurable**: Success criteria include specific metrics (time, percentage, completion rate)
- **User-focused**: All requirements describe user value, not technical implementation

## Notes

### Strengths

1. **Excellent prioritization**: P1 (production blockers) vs P2 (enhancements) clearly distinguished
2. **Comprehensive edge cases**: Covers zero states, errors, extreme values, accessibility
3. **Realistic assumptions**: Documents tech stack choices with rationale (shadcn/ui benefits)
4. **Risk mitigation**: Identifies technical/UX/deployment risks with specific mitigation strategies
5. **Clear constraints**: Time pressure (2-3 days), compatibility requirements, performance targets

### No Issues Found

All validation items passed on first check. No spec updates required before proceeding to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.

### Next Steps

1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
2. Or use `/speckit.clarify` if additional questions arise during planning
3. Specification is production-ready and can guide development immediately
