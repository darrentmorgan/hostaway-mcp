# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Server Issues Resolution

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✅

- **No implementation details**: Specification describes behavior without mentioning FastAPI, Python, or specific libraries
- **User value focused**: Each user story explains the "why" and business impact
- **Non-technical language**: Uses HTTP status codes and API consumer terminology, understandable to product managers
- **Complete sections**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✅

- **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are concrete based on test report findings
- **Testable requirements**: Each FR specifies exact behavior (e.g., "MUST return HTTP 404" not "should handle errors better")
- **Measurable success criteria**:
  - SC-001: 100% correct status codes (quantitative)
  - SC-002: 100% header presence (quantitative)
  - SC-003: Under 5 minutes (time-based)
  - SC-004: Zero false positives/negatives (quantitative)
  - SC-005: Under 500ms (performance metric)
- **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: No mention of middleware implementation, only observable outcomes
- **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each user story has 4 detailed Given/When/Then scenarios
- **Edge cases identified**: 5 specific edge cases covering method handling, concurrent requests, permissions, restart behavior, error scenarios
- **Clear scope**: Out of Scope section explicitly lists what won't be addressed (distributed rate limiting, key rotation, etc.)
- **Dependencies documented**: Supabase, FastAPI middleware, authentication flow, test infrastructure

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✅

- **Clear acceptance criteria**: 15 functional requirements with specific, testable criteria
- **Primary flows covered**: Three prioritized user stories (P1: 404 handling, P2: rate limit headers, P3: key generation)
- **Measurable outcomes defined**: 5 success criteria with quantitative metrics
- **No implementation leakage**: Specification describes "what" not "how" - mentions middleware order conceptually but not implementation details

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ALL CHECKS PASSED ✅

The specification is **production-ready** and can proceed directly to planning (`/speckit.plan`) without requiring clarifications.

**Strengths**:
1. Directly addresses issues from comprehensive test report (MCP_SERVER_TEST_REPORT.md)
2. Each issue prioritized by impact (P1: fundamental REST convention, P2: industry standard, P3: dev experience)
3. All requirements traceable to specific test findings
4. Edge cases anticipate real-world scenarios
5. Assumptions document reasonable defaults (in-memory rate limiting, backward compatibility)
6. Out of scope prevents feature creep

**Ready for next phase**: `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
