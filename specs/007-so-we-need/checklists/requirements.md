# Specification Quality Checklist: Automated CI/CD Pipeline for Hostinger Deployment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

**✅ PASS**: Specification is written in business language without technical implementation details. Uses terms like "deployment workflow," "secure credential management," and "health endpoint" without specifying GitHub Actions YAML, SSH libraries, or Docker commands.

**✅ PASS**: Focused on developer experience and automation value - eliminating manual deployments, ensuring security, providing visibility.

**✅ PASS**: Written for non-technical stakeholders - explains "what" and "why" without "how". A product manager or business stakeholder could understand the feature value.

**✅ PASS**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete and substantive.

### Requirement Completeness Review

**✅ PASS**: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in specification. All requirements are concrete and specific.

**✅ PASS**: All requirements are testable:
- FR-001: Can verify by merging PR and checking workflow triggers
- FR-002: Can verify SSH authentication works
- FR-006: Can inspect logs to verify masking
- etc.

**✅ PASS**: Success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "within 10 minutes"
- SC-002: "95% of deployments"
- SC-005: "99.9% uptime"
- SC-008: "15 minutes to 0 minutes"

**✅ PASS**: Success criteria are technology-agnostic - no mention of GitHub Actions, Docker, or specific tools. Uses outcome-based language like "developers can merge" and "changes are live."

**✅ PASS**: Acceptance scenarios defined for all 4 user stories with Given/When/Then format.

**✅ PASS**: 8 edge cases identified covering failure scenarios, concurrent operations, and resource constraints.

**✅ PASS**: Out of Scope section clearly defines what is NOT included (multi-environment, database migrations, security scanning, etc.).

**✅ PASS**: Dependencies section identifies external services, infrastructure requirements, and existing code dependencies. Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults.

### Feature Readiness Review

**✅ PASS**: Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-012) maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories.

**✅ PASS**: User scenarios cover:
- Primary flow (automated deployment on merge)
- Security (credential management)
- Observability (deployment status)
- Reliability (rollback on failure)

**✅ PASS**: All success criteria are measurable and map to user stories:
- SC-001 to User Story 1 (deployment timing)
- SC-003 to User Story 2 (security)
- SC-004 to User Story 3 (visibility)
- SC-006 to User Story 4 (rollback reliability)

**✅ PASS**: No implementation leakage - specification maintains abstraction level throughout. Terms like "workflow," "secrets," and "health check" describe capabilities without prescribing solutions.

## Notes

All validation items passed on first review. Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`.

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization with rationale for each user story
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Well-defined scope boundaries
- Security considerations integrated throughout
- Measurable success criteria with specific metrics

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (if user has questions)
