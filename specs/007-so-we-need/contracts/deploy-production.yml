# GitHub Actions Workflow Contract: Production Deployment
#
# This contract defines the workflow structure for automated CI/CD deployment
# to Hostinger VPS. It serves as the schema/template for the actual workflow
# implementation in .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml
#
# Feature: Automated CI/CD Pipeline for Hostinger Deployment
# Phase: 1 - Design & Contracts
# Date: 2025-10-19

name: Deploy to Production

# Trigger Configuration
# FR-001: System MUST trigger deployment workflow automatically when PR merged to main
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Only trigger on commits to main branch (post-merge)

  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual triggering for emergency deployments

# FR-010: System MUST prevent deployments when required secrets are missing
# Concurrency control prevents race conditions from concurrent merges
# FR-011: Ensures sequential deployment, no concurrent executions
concurrency:
  group: production-deployment
  cancel-in-progress: false  # Wait for current deployment to finish

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to Hostinger VPS
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # FR-011: Complete deployment within 10 minutes
    timeout-minutes: 10

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout Code

      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Full history for rollback capability

      - name: Validate deployment secrets
        run: |

      # Step 3: Deploy to Hostinger via SSH

      # FR-003: Transfer environment variables from GitHub secrets
      # FR-004: Build Docker container on server
      # FR-006: Mask sensitive values in logs

# Expected Outputs:
# - FR-001: Workflow triggers automatically on PR merge to main
# - FR-002: Successful SSH authentication using GitHub secrets
# - FR-003: Environment variables transferred securely to production
# - FR-004: Docker container built and started on Hostinger
# - FR-005: Health check verifies successful deployment
# - FR-006: All secrets masked in GitHub Actions logs (automatic)
# - FR-007: Previous version backed up before deployment
# - FR-008: Deployment status visible in GitHub Actions UI
# - FR-009: Full deployment logs available for 90 days
# - FR-010: Deployment blocked if secrets missing (fails at SSH step)
# - FR-011: Deployment completes within 10-minute timeout
# - FR-012: Automatic rollback on health check failure

# Success Criteria Mapping:
# - SC-001: Changes live within 10 minutes (timeout enforcement)
# - SC-002: 95% deployment success (monitored via GitHub Actions history)
# - SC-003: Zero credential exposure (GitHub Actions auto-masking)
# - SC-004: Failure detection within 30 seconds (health check + timeout)
# - SC-005: 99.9% uptime (Docker graceful restart, rollback on failure)
# - SC-006: 100% rollback success (tested in workflow)
# - SC-007: Troubleshoot via GitHub Actions logs (90-day retention)
# - SC-008: Manual deployment time reduced to 0 (full automation)
