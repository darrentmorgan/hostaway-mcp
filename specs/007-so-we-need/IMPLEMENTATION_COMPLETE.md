## üöÄ Next Steps: Manual Configuration

To activate the CI/CD pipeline, complete these manual steps:

### Step 1: Configure SSH and GitHub Secrets (30-45 minutes)

Follow the comprehensive guide:
```bash
cat specs/007-so-we-need/SETUP_GUIDE.md
```

Key steps:
1. Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions" -f ~/.ssh/hostaway-deploy`
2. Add public key to Hostinger: `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
3. Configure 9 GitHub Secrets via GitHub UI
4. Verify setup: `./specs/007-so-we-need/verify-setup.sh`

### Step 2: Test the Workflow

**Option A: Manual Trigger (Recommended First Test)**
1. Go to: `https://github.com/[YOUR_ORG]/[YOUR_REPO]/actions`
2. Click "Deploy to Production" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" ‚Üí Select branch `main` ‚Üí "Run workflow"
4. Watch deployment progress in real-time
5. Verify production server updated

**Option B: Test via PR Merge**
1. Create test branch: `git checkout -b test-ci-cd`
2. Make small change: `echo "# CI/CD Active" >> README.md`
3. Commit and push: `git commit -am "test: verify CI/CD" && git push`
4. Create PR and merge to main
5. Deployment should trigger automatically within 30 seconds

### Step 3: Monitor First Deployments

Watch the first 3 deployments to verify:
- [ ] Deployment completes within 10 minutes
- [ ] Health check passes
- [ ] Secrets are masked in logs (show as `***`)
- [ ] Production server reflects changes
- [ ] Backups are created and cleaned up (max 5 retained)

### Step 4: Test Rollback (Optional but Recommended)

Intentionally trigger a rollback to verify safety mechanisms:
1. Temporarily break health endpoint or Docker build
2. Push to main to trigger deployment
3. Verify deployment fails gracefully
4. Verify previous version is restored
5. Verify failure is logged with details
6. Revert breaking change

## üîí Security Highlights

### Implemented Security Features
‚úÖ GitHub Actions secret masking (automatic)
‚úÖ Environment variables instead of direct interpolation (prevents command injection)
‚úÖ SSH key-based authentication (no passwords)
‚úÖ .env file with 600 permissions on server
‚úÖ No secrets in git history (verified)
‚úÖ Private SSH key never logged
‚úÖ Fail-fast on errors (`set -e`, `set -u`, `script_stop: true`)

### Security Validation Completed
- ‚úÖ No SSH private keys found in git repository history
- ‚úÖ .gitignore properly configured to ignore .env files
- ‚úÖ Workflow uses env vars for all user-controlled inputs
- ‚úÖ All secret references use `${{ secrets.NAME }}` syntax

## üìà Expected Performance

Based on design specifications:

| Metric | Target | Actual (Post-Implementation) |
|--------|--------|------------------------------|
| Total deployment time | <10 min | Est. 4-5 minutes |
| Backup creation | <30 sec | Est. 10-15 seconds |
| Health check | <10 sec | 10 seconds (sleep + check) |
| Rollback time | <1 min | Est. 30-45 seconds |
| Manual deployment time | 0 min | 0 min (fully automated) |

## üéì Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Single Comprehensive Workflow
- **Decision**: Implement all 4 user stories in one workflow file
- **Rationale**: Simpler maintenance, easier testing, all features work together
- **Alternative Rejected**: Separate workflows per user story (more complex)

### 2. Backup-Before-Deploy Pattern
- **Decision**: Create timestamped backups before every deployment
- **Rationale**: Fast rollback, no re-deployment needed, keeps last 5 versions
- **Alternative Rejected**: Git-based rollback (slower, requires rebuild)

### 3. Environment Variable Security
- **Decision**: Use `env:` block with `envs` parameter in SSH action
- **Rationale**: Prevents command injection attacks, follows GitHub security best practices
- **Alternative Rejected**: Direct `${{ }}` interpolation in script (security risk)

### 4. Health Check as Deployment Gate
- **Decision**: Require health check to pass before considering deployment successful
- **Rationale**: Catches runtime errors, prevents broken deployments, triggers automatic rollback
- **Alternative Rejected**: Deploy without verification (risk of broken production)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

### Before First Deployment
- [ ] Complete all manual configuration steps in SETUP_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Run `verify-setup.sh` to confirm SSH and Docker are working
- [ ] Verify all 9 GitHub Secrets are configured
- [ ] Test workflow manually before merging to main

### Production Safety
- [ ] Never commit `.env` file to repository
- [ ] Rotate SSH keys every 90 days (set calendar reminder)
- [ ] Monitor first 3 deployments closely
- [ ] Test rollback functionality with intentional failure
- [ ] Keep deployment logs accessible for troubleshooting

### When Things Go Wrong
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. SSH to server and inspect Docker logs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs`
3. Verify GitHub Secrets are configured correctly
4. Check Hostinger server disk space: `df -h`
5. Verify health endpoint is accessible: `curl http://localhost:8080/health`
6. Consult troubleshooting section in SETUP_GUIDE.md
