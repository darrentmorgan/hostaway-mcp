# Specification Quality Checklist: Guest Communication & Enhanced Error Handling (v1.1)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification describes WHAT and WHY without HOW. No mention of Python, FastAPI, or specific technical implementations.

✅ **User value focused**: All three user stories directly address business needs (guest communication context, operational resilience, quality assurance).

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written for property managers and business stakeholders. Technical terms limited to domain concepts (batch operations, message channels).

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present and comprehensive.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No clarification markers**: All requirements are concrete and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each of 18 functional requirements includes verifiable criteria:
- FR-001: "search messages by booking ID" → can verify with booking ID 12345
- FR-007: "handle batch operations with partial failures" → can test with 10 items, 2 invalid
- FR-012: "maintain test coverage ≥80%" → measurable via pytest-cov

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 10 success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "under 2 seconds for bookings with up to 100 messages"
- SC-005: "≥80% across all modules, with ≥90% coverage for new v1.1 features"
- SC-006: "80% compared to v1.0"

✅ **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not implementation:
- "AI agents can retrieve" (not "API responds in")
- "System maintains 99.9% uptime" (not "Docker container uptime")
- "Property managers report ≥90% satisfaction" (business metric, not technical)

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story includes 5 Given-When-Then scenarios covering primary and edge cases.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 10 edge cases documented covering boundary conditions, error scenarios, and system limits.

✅ **Scope bounded**: Out of Scope section explicitly excludes message sending, real-time notifications, translation, analytics, and advanced search. Deferred features listed with target versions.

✅ **Dependencies identified**: External (Hostaway Messages API), Internal (v1.0 systems), and Blocking (test environment access) dependencies all documented.

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: All 18 functional requirements map to testable acceptance scenarios in user stories.

✅ **Primary flows covered**: User Story 1 (message search/history), User Story 2 (partial failures), User Story 3 (test coverage) cover core v1.1 capabilities.

✅ **Measurable outcomes met**: 10 success criteria provide quantitative (performance, coverage, accuracy) and qualitative (satisfaction) measures.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains abstraction. No code snippets, framework references, or technical architecture details.

## Notes

- **Specification Quality**: Excellent. All checklist items pass validation.
- **Readiness**: Feature is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase. No spec updates required.
- **Strengths**:
  - Comprehensive edge case analysis (10 scenarios)
  - Strong risk mitigation strategy (technical + operational risks identified)
  - Clear v1.0 → v1.1 migration path documented
  - Well-defined out-of-scope boundaries prevent scope creep
- **Recommendations**:
  - Validate Hostaway API message endpoints early in planning phase (documented as technical risk)
  - Confirm test environment access before implementation (documented as blocking dependency)
  - Consider feature flags for partial failure handling (documented in risk mitigation)

## Status: ✅ VALIDATED - READY FOR PLANNING
