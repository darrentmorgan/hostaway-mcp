# API Contract Quality Checklist

**Feature**: API-Level Response Summarization (009-add-api-level)
**Purpose**: Documentation Quality - Validate completeness and clarity of API contract requirements
**Depth**: Standard
**Focus**: API Contract Quality
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: Active (Post-Implementation Audit)

---

## Checklist Summary

This checklist validates the **quality of API contract requirements** (not implementation behavior). Each item tests whether the specification documentation is complete, clear, consistent, and measurable for the API-level response summarization feature.

**Intended Use**: Post-implementation audit to ensure requirements are properly documented for future maintainers and API consumers.

## Notes

**Remember**: This checklist tests **requirements quality**, not implementation behavior. Each item asks whether the specification documents are complete, clear, consistent, and measurable - NOT whether the code works correctly.

**Usage Pattern**:
1. Review each item against spec.md, plan.md, data-model.md, and tasks.md
2. Check the box if the requirement is clearly documented
3. Leave unchecked if the requirement is missing, ambiguous, or unclear
4. Use unchecked items to improve documentation quality

**Next Steps**:
- Use unchecked items to identify documentation gaps
- Update spec artifacts to address clarity/completeness issues
- Re-run `/speckit.analyze` to validate improvements
