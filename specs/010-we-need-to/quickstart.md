# Quickstart: Automated Parallel MCP Migration

**Feature**: 010-we-need-to | **Last Updated**: 2025-10-30

## Overview

This guide explains how to run the automated MCP migration system that executes all 7 fixes from `docs/MCP_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` in parallel using git worktrees.

**Expected Duration**: ~4 hours (unattended)
**Manual Intervention**: None required
**Prerequisites**: Git 2.35+, GitHub CLI, Python 3.12+, uv, Node.js (for MCP Inspector)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites Check

```bash
# Verify git version (need 2.35+)
git --version

# Verify GitHub CLI is authenticated
gh auth status

# Verify uv is installed
uv --version

# Verify MCP Inspector available
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --version

# Verify on correct branch
git branch --show-current  # Should be 001-we-need-to or similar
```

### 2. Run Migration

```bash
# From repo root
.automation/scripts/orchestrator.sh

# That's it! The script will:
# - Create checkpoint tag
# - Create 7 worktrees in /tmp/
# - Execute fixes in parallel
# - Run tests for each fix
# - Create PRs
# - Auto-merge after CI passes
# - Clean up worktrees
# - Generate summary report
```

### 3. Monitor Progress

```bash
# In another terminal, watch progress
watch -n 5 .automation/scripts/status.sh

# Or query once
.automation/scripts/status.sh

# View logs
tail -f .automation/logs/orchestrator.log

# View specific worktree log
tail -f .automation/logs/worktree-fix-1-service-prefixes.log
```

### 4. Review Results

```bash
# After completion, view summary
cat .automation/logs/summary-report.md

# Check PRs created
gh pr list --label mcp-migration

# Verify MCP compliance
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector mcp_stdio_server.py

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/mcp/ -v
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Rollback

If something goes wrong and you need to rollback:

```bash
# Emergency rollback to pre-migration state
.automation/scripts/rollback.sh

# This will:
# - Stop all worktrees
# - Close all PRs
# - Reset main branch to checkpoint
# - Clean up temporary files
```

### Dry Run

Test the orchestration without making changes:

```bash
.automation/scripts/orchestrator.sh --dry-run

# Shows:
# - Worktrees that would be created
# - Dependency resolution order
# - Estimated completion time
# - Does NOT create worktrees or PRs
```

### Partial Execution

Run only specific fixes:

```bash
# Run only high-priority fixes (1-4)
.automation/scripts/orchestrator.sh --fixes "fix-1,fix-2,fix-3,fix-4"

# Run only a single fix (useful for debugging)
.automation/scripts/orchestrator.sh --fixes "fix-1-service-prefixes"
```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:

```bash
.automation/scripts/orchestrator.sh --debug

# Logs every command executed
# Useful for troubleshooting
```

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Optional: Override default worktree location
export WORKTREE_BASE_DIR="/custom/path"  # Default: /tmp/hostaway-mcp-worktrees

# Optional: Override base branch
export BASE_BRANCH="main"  # Default: 001-we-need-to

# Optional: Override timeout per fix (seconds)
export FIX_TIMEOUT=10800  # Default: 7200 (2 hours)

# Optional: Disable auto-merge (manual PR merging)
export AUTO_MERGE=false  # Default: true
```

### Config Files

Edit `.automation/config/` files to customize behavior:

**dependency-graph.yaml**: Modify fix dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  - from: fix-1-service-prefixes
    to: fix-4-markdown-support
  - from: fix-3-error-messages
    to: fix-4-markdown-support
```

**worktree-config.yaml**: Adjust worktree settings
```yaml
worktree_base_dir: /tmp/hostaway-mcp-worktrees
branch_prefix: mcp-
cleanup_on_success: true
cleanup_on_failure: false
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Worktree creation fails

**Symptom**: `git worktree add` fails with "path already exists"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clean up stale worktrees
git worktree prune
rm -rf /tmp/hostaway-mcp-worktrees/*

# Re-run orchestrator
.automation/scripts/orchestrator.sh
```

### Issue: Test failures in multiple fixes

**Symptom**: 3+ fixes fail tests

**Solution**:
```bash
# Rollback to checkpoint
.automation/scripts/rollback.sh

# Review failed test logs
cat .automation/logs/test-results/fix-*.log

# Fix underlying issue
# Re-run migration
.automation/scripts/orchestrator.sh
```

### Issue: PR auto-merge not working

**Symptom**: PRs created but not merging

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check CI status
gh pr checks

# If CI failed, view details
gh pr view <pr-number> --web

# If CI passing but not merging, check auto-merge enabled
gh pr view <pr-number> --json autoMergeRequest
```

### Issue: Out of disk space

**Symptom**: Error during worktree creation

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check disk usage
df -h /tmp/

# Worktrees use ~2GB total
# Ensure at least 3GB available in /tmp/

# Clean up old worktrees
git worktree prune
rm -rf /tmp/hostaway-mcp-worktrees/*
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I run this multiple times?**
A: Yes, but only if previous run completed or was rolled back. Active worktrees will block new runs.

**Q: What if I need to pause execution?**
A: There's no pause mechanism. You can stop with Ctrl+C and rollback, or let it complete then revert commits.

**Q: Can I modify fixes during execution?**
A: No. Fixes are applied automatically from migration guide. Customization requires editing the guide first.

**Q: How do I add a new fix?**
A: Add to `docs/MCP_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`, update `.automation/config/fix-definitions.yaml`, and re-run.

**Q: What if CI checks fail?**
A: Auto-merge will not occur. Review CI logs, fix issues, and manually merge or re-run migration.

**Q: Can I run this on a remote server?**
A: Yes, but ensure GitHub CLI is authenticated and you have SSH access for monitoring logs.
