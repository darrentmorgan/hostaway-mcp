# Feature Specification: Automated Parallel MCP Migration

**Feature Branch**: `010-we-need-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we need to execute on the @docs/MCP_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md and we need to do this in parallel with worktrees to speed up development. we need this to be fully automated as i will be afk, it should be able to work through the whole process without my input"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Parallel Development (Priority: P1)

As a developer with limited availability, I need the MCP migration guide to be executed automatically in parallel using git worktrees, so that all 7 improvements can be implemented simultaneously without requiring my manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - unattended parallel execution of the migration guide. Without automation, the 12-16 hour migration becomes a bottleneck requiring constant developer oversight.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by executing the automation workflow and verifying all 7 worktrees are created, all fixes are implemented, all tests pass, and all branches are merged without human input.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the migration guide with 7 distinct fixes (4 HIGH + 3 MEDIUM priority), **When** I trigger the automated workflow, **Then** 7 parallel git worktrees are created, one per fix
2. **Given** 7 worktrees are actively implementing fixes, **When** each fix completes, **Then** automated tests run and pass for that worktree independently
3. **Given** a worktree's tests pass, **When** the fix is complete, **Then** the branch is automatically committed, pushed, and a PR is created
4. **Given** all 7 PRs are created, **When** CI checks pass, **Then** PRs are auto-merged sequentially with proper dependency ordering
5. **Given** the entire workflow is running, **When** an error occurs in one worktree, **Then** other worktrees continue executing and the error is logged for review

---

### User Story 2 - Dependency-Aware Sequencing (Priority: P2)

As a system architect, I need the automation to understand fix dependencies, so that later fixes (like Markdown formatting) can build on earlier fixes (like service prefixes) even when executed in parallel.

**Why this priority**: While parallelization speeds up development, certain fixes depend on others. This prevents broken builds and ensures correctness.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that Fix 4 (Markdown support) correctly references `hostaway_list_properties` (renamed in Fix 1) rather than old tool names.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Fix 1 (service prefixes) completes first, **When** Fix 4 (Markdown) begins implementation, **Then** Fix 4 uses the updated tool names from Fix 1
2. **Given** Fix 3 (error messages) completes before Fix 4 (Markdown), **When** Fix 4 integrates error handling, **Then** it uses the error helper functions from Fix 3
3. **Given** multiple fixes modify the same file section, **When** merging occurs, **Then** conflicts are detected and resolution strategy is applied
4. **Given** a dependency is detected during execution, **When** the dependent fix tries to run, **Then** it waits for the dependency to complete before proceeding

---

### User Story 3 - Comprehensive Test Coverage (Priority: P2)

As a quality engineer, I need automated tests to run for each fix independently, so that I can trust the migration maintains system stability and MCP compliance.

**Why this priority**: Without automated testing, parallel development introduces risk of breaking changes. Independent test suites ensure each fix is validated.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the test suite for Fix 1 in isolation and verifying it validates service prefix changes without requiring other fixes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Fix 1 (service prefixes) is implemented, **When** automated tests run, **Then** MCP Inspector validates tool names have `hostaway_` prefix
2. **Given** Fix 2 (annotations) is implemented, **When** tests run, **Then** schema validation confirms all 7 tools have required annotation fields
3. **Given** Fix 3 (error messages) is implemented, **When** tests run, **Then** error scenarios are tested and actionable guidance is verified
4. **Given** Fix 4 (Markdown) is implemented, **When** tests run, **Then** both JSON and Markdown response formats are validated
5. **Given** all fixes pass tests independently, **When** integration tests run, **Then** the complete MCP server passes end-to-end workflows

---

### User Story 4 - Progress Monitoring and Rollback (Priority: P3)

As a DevOps engineer, I need real-time visibility into the parallel execution status and the ability to rollback if critical issues arise, so that I can maintain system reliability.

**Why this priority**: While not blocking core functionality, monitoring and rollback capabilities are essential for production safety.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating a critical failure and verifying the rollback mechanism restores the system to pre-migration state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 7 worktrees are executing in parallel, **When** I query status, **Then** I see real-time progress for each fix (not started, in progress, testing, complete, failed)
2. **Given** Fix 3 fails integration tests, **When** rollback is triggered, **Then** all incomplete fixes are stopped and merged fixes are reverted
3. **Given** all fixes complete successfully, **When** final validation runs, **Then** production deployment gates are checked before releasing
4. **Given** the workflow completes, **When** summary is generated, **Then** a report shows time saved vs sequential execution, test results, and deployment status

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when two fixes modify overlapping code sections (e.g., Fix 3 and Fix 4 both modify `call_tool` function)?
- How does the system handle a worktree that gets stuck or times out during execution?
- What if GitHub rate limits are hit during parallel PR creation?
- How are test failures in one worktree isolated from other worktrees?
- What happens if the main branch is updated during parallel execution?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST create 7 isolated git worktrees, one for each fix in the migration guide (Fixes 1-4 + Improvements 1-3)
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse the migration guide and extract implementation instructions for each fix
- **FR-003**: System MUST execute all 7 fixes in parallel using separate worktrees to minimize total wall-clock time
- **FR-004**: System MUST run automated tests for each fix independently after implementation
- **FR-005**: System MUST commit changes with descriptive messages following conventional commits format
- **FR-006**: System MUST create GitHub PRs for each fix with migration guide references
- **FR-007**: System MUST auto-merge PRs sequentially after CI passes, respecting dependency order
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle fix dependencies (e.g., Fix 4 depends on Fix 1 for renamed tool names)
- **FR-009**: System MUST detect and resolve merge conflicts using predefined strategies
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide real-time progress monitoring for all parallel executions
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate comprehensive logs for each worktree execution
- **FR-012**: System MUST support rollback to pre-migration state if critical failures occur
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate MCP compliance after each fix using MCP Inspector
- **FR-014**: System MUST produce a final summary report with metrics (time saved, tests passed, fixes merged)

### Key Entities

- **Worktree**: Isolated git working directory for implementing a single fix, with its own branch and execution context
- **Fix**: A discrete improvement from the migration guide (service prefixes, annotations, error messages, Markdown support, descriptions, validation, truncation)
- **Dependency Graph**: Relationship map showing which fixes depend on others (e.g., Fix 4 â†’ Fix 1, Fix 3)
- **Test Suite**: Independent tests for each fix that validate implementation correctness
- **Execution Context**: State tracking for a worktree including status, logs, test results, and errors

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

## Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: The migration guide's code examples are complete and executable without modification
- **Assumption 2**: The existing test infrastructure (pytest) can be extended to validate each fix independently
