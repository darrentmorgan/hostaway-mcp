# Specification Quality Checklist: Automated Parallel MCP Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Validation Results

**All items PASS** - Specification is ready for planning phase

**Strengths**:
- Clear separation between automation workflow (P1) and quality features (P2-P3)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage for parallel execution challenges
- Well-defined dependencies and technical constraints
- Measurable success criteria with baseline comparisons (6.5/10 â†’ 10/10 MCP compliance)
- Technology-agnostic focus on outcomes (time saved, tests passed, zero manual intervention)

**No clarifications needed** - All requirements are unambiguous and based on the detailed migration guide

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
