## 🎉 What We Accomplished

### Critical Bug Fixes

2. **Service Role Authentication** - Implemented service role client for Server Actions to bypass RLS during signup
3. **Dashboard Routing** - Fixed 404 errors by correcting redirects from `/dashboard` → `/settings`

### New Migrations Created

- `20251013000008_drop_recursive_select_policy.sql` - Removed recursive SELECT policy

### New Code Components
- `/dashboard/lib/supabase/service-role.ts` - Service role client for elevated permissions
