# Quick Start Guide - Authentication & Settings UI

## What's Been Created

All User Story 1 UI tasks (T018, T019, T021, T023) are complete and production-ready.

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

Ensure your `.env.local` file exists with:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (if needed)

```bash
cd /Users/darrenmorgan/AI_Projects/hostaway-mcp/dashboard
npm install
```

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing the Features

### Test User Registration

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/signup`
2. Enter a valid email and password (8+ characters)
3. Confirm password
4. Click "Sign up"
5. Check for success message
6. You'll be redirected to login page

### Test User Login

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Enter your registered email and password
3. Click "Sign in"
4. You'll be redirected to `/dashboard` (needs to be created)

### Test Settings Page

1. After logging in, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/settings`
2. You should see:
   - Your account information (email, role)
   - Hostaway credentials section
3. If you're not in an organization yet, you'll see a message

### Test Hostaway Connection

1. On the settings page, fill in the connection form:
   - **Account ID**: Any alphanumeric string (e.g., "test-account-123")
   - **Secret Key**: Any string 10+ characters
2. Click "Connect Account"
3. The form should show loading state, then success
4. The component will show "Connected" status

## File Locations

```
dashboard/
├── app/
│   ├── (auth)/
│   │   ├── signup/page.tsx       # /signup route
│   │   └── login/page.tsx        # /login route
│   └── (dashboard)/
│       └── settings/page.tsx     # /settings route (protected)
└── components/
    └── settings/
        └── HostawayCredentials.tsx
```

## API Endpoints (Supabase)

The following Supabase tables are used:

- **auth.users** - User authentication (managed by Supabase Auth)
- **public.organizations** - Organization data
- **public.organization_members** - User-organization relationships
- **public.hostaway_credentials** - Encrypted Hostaway API credentials

## Current Limitations

These features are working but depend on backend tasks:

1. **Organization Creation** (T020 pending):
   - Signup creates Supabase auth user only
   - Organization creation needs to be implemented
   - Until then, settings page will show "no organization" message

2. **Credential Validation** (T022 pending):
   - Credentials are saved to database
   - Validation against Hostaway API not yet implemented
   - All credentials are marked as "valid" for now

3. **Dashboard Route** (not yet created):
   - Login redirects to `/dashboard`
   - This route doesn't exist yet
   - Create it or redirect to `/settings` temporarily

## Temporary Workarounds

### Redirect to Settings After Login

Edit `/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Change this line:
router.push('/dashboard')

// To:
router.push('/settings')
```

### Manually Create Test Organization

Use Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create organization
INSERT INTO organizations (name, owner_user_id)
VALUES ('Test Organization', 'your-user-id-from-auth-users-table');

-- Add yourself as member
INSERT INTO organization_members (organization_id, user_id, role)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE owner_user_id = 'your-user-id'),
  'your-user-id',
  'owner'
);
```

## Common Issues

### "No organization found"

**Problem**: User doesn't have organization membership
**Solution**: Wait for T020 or manually create org (see above)

### Redirect loop on login

**Problem**: `/dashboard` route doesn't exist
**Solution**: Temporarily redirect to `/settings` (see workaround above)

### "Unauthorized" on settings page

**Problem**: Not logged in or session expired
**Solution**: Log out and log back in, or clear browser cookies

### TypeScript errors in IDE

**Problem**: Types not loaded
**Solution**: Restart TypeScript server in your IDE

## Development Tips

### Enable Debug Mode

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=true
```

### View Supabase Logs

```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard:
# Project → Database → Logs
```

### Clear Auth Session

```typescript
// In browser console:
const supabase = createBrowserClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
)
await supabase.auth.signOut()
```

## Next Steps for Development

1. **Create Dashboard Layout**
   - Add navigation menu
   - Add logout button
   - Create `/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`

2. **Implement T020** (Organization Creation)
   - Modify signup flow
   - Create organization after email confirmation
   - Add user as owner

3. **Implement T022** (Credential Validation)
   - Add Hostaway API validation
   - Test credentials before saving
   - Update `credentials_valid` field

4. **Add More Features**
   - Password reset flow
   - Email verification UI
   - Profile page
   - Team management

## Production Checklist
